    <p>Patrick Star is SpongeBob's best friend as well as one of his neighbors, and also the deuteragonist of the show as well. He is a naive and overweight <b><span style="color: pink; font-weight:">PINK</span></b> sea star. Patrick is quite overweight due to his laziness as well as his enjoyment of eating ice cream, Krabby Patties, Triple Gooberberry Sunrises, Krusty Combos, and many other kinds of junk food and inedible sources.</p>

	<p>He lives under a brown rock in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob and Squidward are his neighbors. Both Patrick and SpongeBob bother Squidward, though they do not like to do it and they do it unknowingly and have good intentions.</p>

	<p>Patrick also has an older sister. Her first mentioning is in "Something Smells," but in that episode, he claims he doesn't have a sister.</p>

	<h3>Her name</h3>

	<p>Despite being the deuteragonist of the show, he has the third most appearances in the series, behind Squidward, and then SpongeBob, who appears in all of the episodes except "The Algae's Always Greener," in which his dimensional counterpart appears.</p>
